# Zapier Office 365 Admin App

Administer your Office 365 account via Zapier.

## Getting Started

Unfortunately as we have no direct affiliation with Microsoft this app cannot appear in the Zapier public gallery.

### Installing

You can however make use of it either by using it as a [beta tester](https://zapier.com/platform/public-invite/8939/5bc6b498e7707e38fc340562cc461fe4/) or by cloning this repo and publishing it to your own Zapier account via the CLI. Further information can be [found here](https://zapier.github.io/zapier-platform-cli/cli.html).
